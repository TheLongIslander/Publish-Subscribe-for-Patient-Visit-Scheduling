**IMPORTANT**: Including the 'cred.env' file is critical for email notifications to actually work. If this is not included, then this portion of the program will not function as it contains the token for Google authentication for the burner email address.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, if you want to test email notifications, please first use the 'update-emails' API endpoint to update the email to an email you have access to. Otherwise, the emails will be sent to newdoctor@example.com and newsecretary@example.com respectively!

# Reservation System API

## Overview
This Reservation System API is designed to handle reservation requests, including finding available dates, making, looking up, and cancelling reservations. The API leverages Express.js for server handling, SQLite3 for database interactions, and includes custom utility functions for date handling and validation. It now also supports email notifications and audit logging of cancellations.

## Files and Their Roles
1. **server.js**: itializes the Express application, sets up middleware, connects to the SQLite database, listens for requests on a specified port, and handles OAuth2 authentication for email notifications.
2. **reservationsRoutes.js**: Defines API endpoints for various reservation actions and routes them appropriately. Includes new endpoint for updating notification email addresses.
3. **reservationsHandler.js**: Contains functions that interact directly with the SQLite database to perform actions like checking date availability, creating, and cancelling reservations.
4. **utils.js**: Provides utility functions for date manipulation, holiday checking, format conversion, and email notifications support.
5.  **schedulerSpec.js**: Provides Jasmine Supertest cases to run test cases on the server. This file is located in the "spec" directory within the main project directory.
6. **publisher.js**: Implements a publisher-subscriber pattern to manage notifications for different events.
7. **notification.js**: Manages the sending of email notifications and audit log entries for reservation cancellations.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
2. Start the application by running 
	
	node server.js 

The server will start and listen for requests on port 3000.

**IMPORTANT**: To use email notification features, make sure to update your email using the POST /api/update-emails endpoint!
